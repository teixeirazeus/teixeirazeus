Ah ah ah! Hello! I am Count von Count, but you can simply call me "The Count." Welcome to my GitHub profile!<br>
I've been counting ever since I was a little countling in Transylvania, and now, I've transitioned into counting lines of code! Ah ah ah!

## 🖥️ What I'm Currently Working On

1️⃣ A program to count the number of bats in my castle.<br>
2️⃣ An app that plays the delightful sound of thunder every time I finish counting something.<br>
3️⃣ An AI to keep track of the number of times Ernie has borrowed Bert's rubber duckie.<br>
